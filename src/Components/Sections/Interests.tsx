                        Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors.
                        Playing sports is my go to activity especially cricket with my gang.
                        During post monsons, I would like to go for a trek.

                        When forced indoors, I follow a number of action-drama and thriller genre movies and television shows, 
                        and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the web development world.</p>
